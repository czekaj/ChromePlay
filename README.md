Google Chrome browser extension - allows sending YouTube videos to AppleTV via AirPlay

You can press the extension icon while watching video on youtube.com to stream it on your AppleTV or right click a youtube.com url and select "AirPlay it!".

Installation
------------
There's no package yet so just clone the repository and install it by clicking "Load unpacked extension..." in Chrome.

Notes
-----
- Best quality MP4 video is chosen automatically
- Right now the extension supports only AppleTVs with default host name: apple-tv.local (should work with default setup)
- Google Chrome has to be running while watching video but the actual streaming is done exclusively by AppleTV itself. There's no need to keep the video page open.
- Tested with Google Chrome 33 beta on OSX Mavericks and Windows 7.
